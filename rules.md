# Secret Hitler: Double Agent Double Trouble Expansion Pack
Idea started by talking with Micah and Sarah on the phone Saturday 2018-12-22.

## Intro
Remember all those forked timelines you somehow lived through of the historical period starting in 1932 and leading up to the Third Reich or lack thereof in Germany? Remember how the Fascists were a bunch of sneaks who somehow had figured out who each other were? Remember how Fascists smugly coasted on this knowledge? Remember how the Liberals had consistent tragicomedic trust issues due to their difficulties identifying one another? Isn’t it strange that you somehow remember so many forked timelines around this point in history?

It is a little strange. But what if things could have been different? What if the Fascists had a genre of trust issue all their own?

## The Double Agent
The Secret Hitler: Double Agent Double Trouble expansion pack introduces a special new role: the Double Agent. The Double Agent is on the Liberal team, but has infiltrated the Fascist party. Will the Double Agent be found out? Will the Double Agent assassinate Secret Hitler? Will the Liberal-Fascist conflict come to a relatively boring legislative conclusion? Only you, your party, and that accursed stack of policies can decide.

## Contents
This expansion pack consists of two cards: an additional Fascist Party Membership card and a single new card, the Liberal Double  Agent Party Membership card.

But really, since I can’t produce Party Membership cards that look like they’re real, this expansion pack includes the two cards mentioned above plus nine other party membership cards: five Liberal, four Fascist.

## Setup
Only use this expansion pack with seven or more players. Replace one Liberal role with the  Liberal Double Agent role.

The envelope for the Liberal Double Agent role contains a Nein Ballot card, a Ja! Ballot card, and a Fascist Party Membership card.  In addition, instead of a Secret Role card, the envelope contains a Liberal Double Agent Party Membership card. The Liberal Double Agent Party Membership card has the same back as a Party Membership card, but has the Liberal Double Agent role printed on its face.

## Important Logistical Rule
Until the game is over, all players must keep their Secret Role cards inside their envelopes so no other player may see the back nor the front of any other player’s Secret Role card.

## Coup Liberal Victory by Assassination in the Legislative Chamber
This expansion pack introduces a new way for Liberals to win. The Liberals win if the Double Agent and Secret Hitler are elected to the same government after three Fascist policies have been passed.

## New Game Mechanic: Fascist Traitor Assassination
At any point in the game, any Fascist may say “I assassinate [player name] for being a traitor to the Fascist cause”.

* If the named player is a Fascist, they die.
* If the named player is the Double Agent, they die. In addition, the Double Agent must choose a second Liberal who also dies with them.
* If the named player is a Liberal, the Fascist who attempted the assassination dies.

Dead players are removed from the game and may not speak, vote, or run for office.

The Double Agent may not carry out a Traitor Assassination.

## Investigating the Double Agent
When a player uses the Investigate Loyalty Presidential Power, the Double Agent behaves this way under investigation:

* If the investigating player is Fascist, the Double Agent shows them a Fascist Party Membership card.
* If the investigating player is Liberal, the Double Agent shows them the Liberal Double Agent Party Membership card.

## Strategy Notes and Corollaries
* *Barring mistakes, the Fascists almost always win if their party holds a majority or a 50-50 split, even if the Liberals know who the Fascists are.* This happens simply due to both how the electoral process works and the 11-Fascist, 6-Liberal makeup of the policy deck.
* *It is important for a Liberal Double Agent under Loyalty Investigation to be inconspicuous about the fact they are choosing between two different Party Membership cards to secretly present.* A mistake here could easily cost the game.
* *It is important for a Liberal who has performed a Loyalty Investigation against the Liberal Double Agent to keep the Double Agent’s identity a secret.* If the Liberal who performed the investigation decides to publicly disclose the investigation result, their best option is to say the Double Agent is Fascist so as to not risk the life of the Double Agent. Announcing the Double Agent as a Fascist is itself risky: another Liberal might later use an Execution power to kill the Double Agent, believing them to actually be Fascist.
* *Each non-game-ending election after three Fascist policies have been passed now provides additional information.* Not only is it known that any successfully elected Chancellor is not Hitler, it is also known that assuming a government’s President was Hitler, that government’s Chancellor was not the Double Agent.
