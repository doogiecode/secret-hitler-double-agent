# Secret Hitler: Double Agent Double Trouble Expansion Pack

Rules version: `2019-004`


## Intro

Remember all those forked timelines you somehow lived through of the historical period starting in 1932 and leading up to the Third Reich or lack thereof in Germany? Remember how the Fascists were a bunch of sneaks who somehow had figured out who each other were? Remember how Fascists smugly coasted on this knowledge? Remember how the Liberals had consistent tragicomedic trust issues due to their difficulties identifying one another? Isn’t it strange that you somehow remember so many forked timelines around this point in history?

It is a little strange. But what if things could have been different? What if the Fascists had a genre of trust issue all their own?


## The Double Agent

The Secret Hitler: Double Agent Double Trouble expansion pack introduces a special new role: the Double Agent. The Double Agent is on the Liberal team, but has infiltrated the Fascist party. Will the Double Agent be discovered and purged? Will the Double Agent assassinate Secret Hitler? Will the Liberal-Fascist conflict come to a relatively boring legislative conclusion? Only you, your party, and that accursed stack of policies can decide.


## Materials

To play this expansion pack, you'll need to replace cards in one Liberal envelope: the Liberal role card needs to become a Double Agent role card, and the Liberal party membership card needs to become a Fascist party membership card. (The Double Agent has done a very good job infiltrating. They remain truly Liberal in their heart, and they still win with the Liberals.)

But since you probably don't have any extra cards laying around, try this:

* Buy some card [sleeves](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072ZY1H1X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). 
* Use the print and play edition of Secret Hitler to print yourself one Fascist party membership card and one Liberal role card on plain paper. ([This version](http://william.money/secret/secret-hitler-print-n-play-color.pdf) from a [kind redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/3yepx7/i_made_a_print_and_play_secret_hitler/) is in color, which is nice.)
* Get creative to turn the Liberal role card into a Double Agent card. Use some art supplies or a presidential sharpie or something.
* Insert your new role and party membership cards atop the old ones inside sleeves. The Double Agent envelope is complete.
* Maybe you'll now bring up that the two extra sheets of paper will make the Double Agent envelope a little bit thicker, perhaps perceptibly, and this could out the Double Agent. Well, maybe you can also bring up a way to deal with that yourself. You sure sound like a smart cookie.

You'll also need to have about five slips of paper and five pens or pencils ready.

## Setup

Only use this expansion pack with nine or more players. Replace one Liberal role with the  Double Agent role. (If you decide to try it with less players, feel free to send us feedback on how it went.)

The envelope for the Liberal Double Agent role contains a Nein Ballot card, a Ja! Ballot card, a Double Agent role card, and a Fascist party membership card.


## Starting the Game

The game start has one significant change: the Double Agent opens their eyes along with the Fascists, and so each Fascist sees one additional pair of eyes looking back at them. The Double Agent knows just as much as each player in a Fascist role.

## Coup Liberal Victory by Assassination in the Legislative Chamber

This expansion pack introduces a new way for Liberals to win. The Liberals win if the Double Agent and Secret Hitler are elected to the same government after three Fascist policies have been passed.


## New Game Mechanic: Fascist Party Purge

At almost* any point in the game, Secret Hitler may begin a Purge by announcing "It is now time to initiate a purge."

Once a Purge is initiated, the main gameplay of Secret Hitler is over, and the Purge begins. The Purge will decide the game. Liberals do not have any direct role during a Purge. The Purge proceeds this way:

* Each Fascist, the Double Agent, and Secret Hitler pick up a piece of paper and a pen. Each non-Double-Agent Liberal is now identified, as is Secret Hitler. The only remaining unknown in the game is who among the rank-and-file Fascists is a Double Agent.
* A Liberal volunteer starts a three minute timer.
* The Fascist party discusses among themselves with the goal of identifying the Double Agent. Each Fascist party member writes down a name on their slip of paper and hands the paper to Secret Hitler before the end of the three minutes.
* At the conclusion of the three minutes, Secret Hitler reads out each slip of paper. If everyone except the Double Agent has written down the Double Agent's name, the Double Agent, Secret Hitler executes the Double Agent, making for a successful purge, and the Fascist party wins the game. Otherwise, the Double Agent then assassinates Hitler, ending the game in a Liberal win.

*NOTE*: It is possible for a successful Purge to be impossible from the outset, because the Double Agent may have already been formally executed by use a Fascist presidential power. In this case, the Purge still happens as usual, but Secret Hitler after reading the votes out simply dies of a heart attack brought on by anxious paranoia, and game ends in a Liberal win.

&#42; There is a period during each game round when initiating a Purge is forbidden: from after a government's President touches the policy deck until any resulting Presidential Powers are used. (If a Liberal policy is passed, the off-limits period ends once the policy is on the board.)



## Strategy and Side Notes

* **Playing as the Double Agent**: The Double Agent is a tricky and strange role. The most important aspect of the role is to appear Fascist to other Fascists, so as to avoid being found out and purged. Assassinating Secret Hitler by being elected to the same government together after putting three Fascist policies on the board is a rare way to win, but it is  satisfying. Always be ready to pin the Double Agent role on someone else in the Fascist party in the event of a Purge.
* **Investigating the Double Agent**: When a Liberal using the investigation power on another player, it is important for them to keep in mind even if they see a Fascist party membership card, they may have investigated the Double Agent, who is supporting the Liberal cause, however silently.
* **Purge time limit**: If three minutes seems like too little or too much time to you, you and your friends can decide to adjust the time limit to better suit what you like.
* **New end-game information**: Each non-game-ending election after three Fascist policies have been passed now provides additional information. Not only is it known that any successfully elected Chancellor is not Hitler, it is also known that assuming a government’s President was Hitler, that government’s Chancellor was not the Double Agent.
* **Desperation Purge**: If the Liberal party has the upper hand and is on the verge of winning, it is wise for Secret Hitler to initiate a Purge, even if there is no clarity as to the identity of the Double Agent. The Purge becomes a political mini-game in this case, during which the bluffing skills of the Double Agent are pivotal.

Best wishes for keeping your friendships intact.
